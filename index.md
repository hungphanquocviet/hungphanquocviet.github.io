I'm Hung, a **Computer Science and Applied Mathematics** student at the University of Utah. I have experience in back-end development and data science, and I enjoy exploring topics in algorithms, computer graphics, and data-driven technologies.

In my free time, I enjoy watching anime, playing instruments, and solving coding problems.
